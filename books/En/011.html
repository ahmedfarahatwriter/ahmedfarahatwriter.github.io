            <p id="description"><strong>Description:</strong> When the pandemic ended and the darkness lifted, I found life bleak and hopeless. A young man in the prime of life, I had suddenly lost family, teachers, and friends. It was a colossal shock whose effects I endured for a long time. At night, I would choke with fear and terror. The sight of the city was dismal, and sorrow filled every corner. Suddenly, I was completely alone. I had not yet finished my education and possessed no skills to work. I felt that life was falling apart and all hopes were collapsing. 

            Yet amidst that overwhelming darkness, a light appeared that saved me and restored my hope. It was my teacher, Sheikh Al-Abli, who had saved me from that deadly pandemic in the first place. When everything was over, I thought he would leave, but he stayed. He did not abandon me and pulled me out of the crushing sorrow that nearly destroyed me. The man came to me and said, "Do not fear anything, for I am with you and will not leave you."</p>
