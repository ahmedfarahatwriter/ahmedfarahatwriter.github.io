            <h1 id="title">Writing in the dark</h1>
            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Ahmed Farahat</p>
            <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Writing Tips</p>
            <p><strong>Published:</strong> 2024</p>
            <p id="description"><strong>Description:</strong> Sixteen complete adventures I have experienced, and finally, I feel ready to answer those questions about writing—or rather, the mysteries behind its scenes. Though I remain convinced that I still have much to explore in this magical world, I decided to embark on this delightful experiment. Perhaps it will serve as a guide for anyone wishing to venture into the realm of writing.  
            <br><br>
            This is my way of fulfilling a small part of the promise I made to myself: to pave the way for anyone who sees within themselves the potential to write, no matter the subject. Maybe, in the future, I’ll revisit this experience with fresh insights and broader expertise, turning it into a testament to growth, exploration of more intricate paths, and experimentation with new forms of writing to uncover their outcomes.  
            <br><br>    
            So let’s embark on this exciting journey together. I hope this serves as a simple, accessible guide to beginning the adventure of stepping into the dark forest, putting ideas on paper, and emerging with a complete book. A book that contains those ideas that, one day, might change the world.</p>
