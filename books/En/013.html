            <p id="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The Islamic Empire experienced one of the most complex periods in world history during the Middle Ages. This era marked the fragmentation of the empire into multiple entities: the Fatimid Caliphate in Egypt, the Abbasid Caliphate in Iraq, and the Seljuk Empire in Persia (modern-day Iran). These divisions were accompanied by relentless religious and political conflicts across the region. At the same time, the empire faced external pressures from the east with the Mongol invasions led by Genghis Khan and later his grandson Hulagu, and from the west with the Crusades initiated by European forces. The region became a battleground for the great powers of the ancient world.  
            <br><br>
            Amid this turmoil, the Assassins' movement emerged, founded by Hasan-i Sabbah. This secretive group relied heavily on targeted assassinations to eliminate opposition, leaving an indelible impact on the region from east to west. Their tactics instilled fear in the hearts of kings, sultans, ministers, and clergy alike. Even the Mongols, infamous for their brutality and destruction, considered the Assassins one of the greatest threats on their path to conquering the Abbasid Caliphate.  
            <br><br>
            From another perspective, the German priest Brocardus warned of their dangerous influence, describing them as follows:  
            "The Assassins, whom humanity must curse and avoid, sell themselves for blood money. They thirst for human lives, killing innocents for a fee, showing no regard for life or salvation. They disguise themselves like demons turning into angels, imitating the movements, clothes, languages, and customs of different peoples."
            <br><br>
            Such was the fear and mystique surrounding the Assassins, a group whose actions left a profound mark on history and shaped the narratives of their era.</p>
