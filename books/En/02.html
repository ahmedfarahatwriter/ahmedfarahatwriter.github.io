            <p id="description"><strong>Description:</strong> "The algoritmi was proving day by day that he was the scientest that should truly hold the honour of this title, the title of a scientist, as if the language had been as serious as that title to be held by men as it was by algoritmi, a man dedicated to science as to doom." The journey of a genius child embarked on a scientific journey from the city of Khawarzam in Khorasan province until his arrival in Baghdad, the capital of science, in the era of the Abbasid State, to make his way to the skies of science flying above all the scientists of his time. The story of the extraordinary mathematician and astronomer Muhammad bin Musa al-Khawarzmi, a journey fraught with difficulties and dangers, in a period when science was developing enormously and needed men as much as algorithmic, a man of science who changed the history of science and if not for the delay of current scientific progress thousands of years. 

            Yet amidst that overwhelming darkness, a light appeared that saved me and restored my hope. It was my teacher, Sheikh Al-Abli, who had saved me from that deadly pandemic in the first place. When everything was over, I thought he would leave, but he stayed. He did not abandon me and pulled me out of the crushing sorrow that nearly destroyed me. The man came to me and said, "Do not fear anything, for I am with you and will not leave you."</p>
