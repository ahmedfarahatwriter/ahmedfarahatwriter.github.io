            <p><strong>Author:</strong> Ahmed Farahat</p>

            <p id="description"><strong>Description:</strong> The future of culture at this moment seems foggy and distorted, lacking clear features. Therefore, we must work tirelessly to save the deteriorating state we are living in. These are my personal proposals and my perspective on some suggested solutions. Perhaps I have made mistakes, or perhaps I have been right. Some suggestions might seem impractical, while others could be easily implemented. This is merely a personal effort, stemming from my belief that as a writer and a member of society, it is my duty to contribute ideas that can elevate thought and culture as much as possible.  
            <br>
            Instead of indulging in empty theorizing that leads nowhere, I strive to begin with myself and fulfill my responsibility toward culture and intellectual progress. I hope I have succeeded in presenting practical solutions that can help raise the level of culture in society. I pray that our cultural future will be bright and honorable, and that we will once again reach the heights from which we have strayed. Creativity remains deeply embedded in our souls; we only need to uncover it and bring it forth from within.  
            <br>    
            There are countless creatives among us, and the chain of creativity will never be broken. All we need to do is discover these talents, nurture their skills, and support them, so that this effort will ultimately reflect positively on society as a whole.</p>
